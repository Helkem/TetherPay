A Web3 React App Frontend that can be used to send Tether tokens to any ETH address.  
Uses the help of the Wagmi and viem libraries to interact with the Tether ERC20 smart contract.
Also uses Rainbow kit to connect the users Web3 Wallets
This is built on the official Ethereum mainet so do not send any real tokens unless you would want to.
